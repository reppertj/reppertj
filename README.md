## Hi there üëã I'm Justin Reppert

A data scientist software engineer with a background in applied statistics üìä and the philosophy of mathematics, I like building practical tools using machine learning models and thinking about ML infrastructure ‚òÅÔ∏è, measuring and monitoring model performance ‚è±, and ETL pipelines.

Check out some of my projects:

- [Earworm üé∏](https://github.com/reppertj/earworm), a sound-based search engine for music licensed for royalty-free commercial use. It uses PyTorch, React, FastAPI, Postgres, TypeScript, and TensorflowJS and can be scaled in production using Docker swarm mode.
- [Image Captioning üñº](https://github.com/reppertj/image-captioning), a framework for experimenting with image captioning architectures in PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning.
- [Philosophical Graphiti](https://github.com/reppertj/philosophical-graphiti), a webapp for exploring and visualizing relationships among philosophical topics. It uses Django, Postgres, NetworkX, and Vega.

I have a PhD in Philosophy, with a dissertation defending a classical phenomenological approach to the philosophy of mathematics. Talk to me about Edmund Husserl, formal semantics, or impredicativity!

Before and during graduate school, I helped support international development evaluations for companies including [Social Impact](https://socialimpact.com/), [DevTech](https://devtechsys.com/), and the [QED Group](https://www.qedgroupllc.com/). Ask me about using experimental methods to learn about development effectiveness and making stats-heavy reports clear and readable to subject-matter experts and management.

I'm currently looking for work in data science, ML, and backend roles. Read more at [justinreppert.com](https://www.justinreppert.com/) or reach out to talk via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinreppert/) or email at justin [at] justinreppert [dot] com.
